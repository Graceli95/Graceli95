- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Grace Li
- ðŸ‘€ In 5 years I want to become a highly skilled programmer, make a significant impact in this industry, grow my responsibilities, lead complex projects, contribute to open source, learn how to drive growth and success at my company, give back to my community, and develop projects that solve real world problems.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, SQL, React, and Spring Boot.  Currently finishing up my enrollment in Per Scholas Java Fullstack Bootcamp.
- ðŸ©· In my free time I like to watch live music performances, read, and bake delicious breads and dessert with Focaccia bread and Tiramisu being my favorites. I stay active and enjoy hiking, swimming, traveling, and doing yoga. I take a pottery class weekly and I really enjoy creating and building things with my hands.
- ðŸ¥‡ A life goal of mine is I commit to building my life in a meaningful way. As a first-generation immigrant, I desire to be a professional in Tech, develop and strengthen impactful skills in my career, create a loving family while also giving back to my family in China to support those who helped me reach where I am today.

- ðŸ“« reach me at graceli9095@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have been to Thailand, Japan, Philippines, Australia, and Romania.
